<p>Several people have influenced the work I do on the GlassLibrary. Simple adding them as contributors simple wouldn't give them enough credit. Without the people below, the GlassLibrary wouldn't be what it is today.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Mr. H, my first computer science teacher</b>: On the first day of the little summer class my friend's dad put on, he showed us a line of code: 1 = 1. The console returned True. I thought he lost his mind. Looking back, that's the most important lesson in computer science I've had to this day. True things are true, false things are false, and the rest of computer logic is built from there. Its safe to say, this simple demonstration in 5th grade is the reason I code today.</p>
<p><b>Mr. C, my web design teacher:</b> You taught me everything I know about HTML. Your class is fantastic and its safe to say I would never have made a website without it. Turns out HTML is pretty important to a webpage. Who would've guessed?</p>
<p><b>The Modern Rogue:</b> When it was originally created, the GlassLibrary was named the Rogue's Archive. Much like the principals of being a Modern Rogue, the archive was made to allow people to learn any skill, be self reliant, and to work for the greater (or sometimes dangerous, most fun, anti bad guys, or most beneficial) good. Although the name changed, the idea is still the same. Brian Brushwood and Jason Murphy's work will forever be a major inspiration for the GlassLibrary. Also, bolt your vice to the table.</p>
<p><b>Matt Parker & Steve Mould:</b> It wouldn't be off to call these two math and science geniuses, respectively. Both have had heavy influence of my love of maths and physics. Their entertaining, and sometimes slightly strange, demonstrations of knowledge heavily inspired me to want to create something to help people learn. Thus, the first math and science texts were added to the GlassLibrary, and have been some of the most widely archive topics ever since. Stay nerdy.</p>
<p><b>Julian Assange, Satoshi Nakamoto, & Ross Ulbricht</b>: Beliefs and works of these 3 men have all had direct influence in the making of the GlassLibrary. Satoshi Nakamoto and Ross Ulbricht both set out to make resources (money and marketplace, respectively) that were free to use, un-censorable, and free of a central governing body. Julian Assange created a place where information that is important to the people, yet would have never reached them, can be safe and spread. All these ideologies made the GlassLibrary what it is now, a free, open, censorshipless archive where information, knowledge, and history can be safe and shared. I wish you all the best.</p>
<p>Several YouTube creators have inspired me to make the GlassLibrary, either through making me want to help people learn, fight censorship, archive data, or love computer science. These channels include (but not at all limited to) <b>Adam Savage's Tested</b>, <b>ashens</b>, <b>carykh</b>, <b>Code Bullet</b>, <b>Cody'sLab</b>, <b>Computerphile</b>, <b>Explosions&Fire</b>, <b>How To Make Everything</b>, <b>NileRed</b>, <b>Numberphile</b>, <b>Sam O'Nella</b>, <b>sentdex</b>, <b>The Thought Emporium</b>, <b>TheCrafsMan SteadyCraftin</b>, <b>Tom Scott</b>, and so many more. I've also been influenced by artists who use their influence for good and activism, such as <b>grandson</b>, <b>Oddisee</b>, and <b>Run The Jewels</b>.</p>
<p>And of course, I had to save the most important for last, the biggest influence on my work, my grandfather. He was the best handyman, the closest person to a real life MacGyver, and one of the kindest humans I knew. He always know exactly how to fix something, and if he didn't, he was ready to learn how to. I built the GlassLibrary as a source of free and open knowledge so people like him could always find the texts they needed. He passed away shortly before this project began, but his inspiration and influence will live on in every project I do for the rest of my life. If I live to be even half the man he was, I would consider that a life well lived. I'll keep your Leatherman safe ;)</p>

<p>Without the people above, as well as the other GlassTeam members and contributors, the GlassLibrary wouldn't be what it is today, that is if I ever made it at all. I cannot thank you all enough.
